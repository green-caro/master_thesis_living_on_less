# master_thesis_living_on_less
This repository holds the code for the clustering analysis performed within my master thesis with the title "Living on Less - Sufficiency-enabling Policies as a Lever for a Just Housing Transition in Germany".

Before running the notebooks one should download the added data file ZA5851_v1-0-0.sav and place it in a folder called "data".
Then at the same location as the notebooks, one should create two folders "figures" and "tables".
The figures and tables will be saved here.

The three jupyter notebooks should be run in the following order:
1. data_cleaning_gesis_data
2. EDA_gesis_data
3. clustering_gesis_data

In each notebook the needed packages are stated and comments guide the user through the analysis.
